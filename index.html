								<p>You use tech and in order to use that tech, you have to give data. You sign up for a bank account and give your sensitive data, but then you can't remember a different password a billion times so you use it once. Well what happens when a hacker gets your data. The hacker can suddenly do an incredible amount of damage. They can look at stuff like:</p>
                                <ul class = "alt">
                                    <li>Payment Information</li>
                                    <li>Passwords</li>
                                    <li>Social Security Numbers</li>
                                    <li>Medical Information</li>
                                    <li>Federal Documents</li>
                                    <li>Signatures</li>
                                    <li>Content dependent on the service</li>
                                </ul>
								<p>This is horrendous, but you can obviously try to change your passwords and protect yourself when these events occur, but most businesses don't even tell you immediately. Some wait months and even in those months don't accomodate or fix the bug. Obviously, having your data given to someone you didn't authorize to is horrible but businesses can use the information that you give them already and hand them to another person you didn't authorize at all, but 'legally.' Essentially, instead of someone else hacking into the business and stealing it, the business just gives it to someone else entirely and makes a quick buck as well. They do this under the fact that you signed the terms of conditions, and they can do anything now. Everyone has a right to privacy and have it protected but these businesses aren't held accountable for these cybersecurity failures with most not even offering accomodation to those who fell prey to the breach. It is time that these businesses are held accountable and can finally start to work so something of the manner can't occur again.</p>

								<p>To avoid being subject to these breaches of data and privacy there are a few things that you as an individual can do:</p>
                                <ul class="alt">
                                    <li>Put a minimal amount of your private informatoin online.</li>
                                    <li>Put your information on respected websites.</li>
                                    <li>Email your local MPs, so that businesses have to help protect your data.</li>
                                    <li>Vote for local MPs who will focus on these regulations.</li>
                                    <li>Sign petitions.</li>
                                    <li>Create different unique passwords for all websites and use security measures like 2-Factor Authentication.</li>
                                    <li>If you are affected, find which type of data is released and contact your financial providers.</li>
                                    <li>Check if you have been affected <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/">here.</a></li>
                                    <li>Don't use services like Facebook to sign up for new accounts.</li>
                                    <li>Be aware of internet scams.</li>
                                    <li>Spread the message and become more involved in protecting your data privacy.</li>
                                </ul>
								<p>These are some of the procedures you can take to protect your own data but becoming literate in media and following the #yourdata movement. Making sure you understand which company you can trust and which data you should give or not.</p>

								<p> As we move toward the age of technology, we are relying on services and companies to store our personal information on the cloud. But what if that information gets breached? What if everyone’s personal information was accessible to anyone, including people with malicious intent?</p>
                                <p> In September of 2017, Equifax announced that the information of over 143 million consumers were exposed  in a data breach. The issue here? The breach happened several weeks ago, and no announcement was made until after the initial chaos. The problem here is that Equifax was not completely transparent to their consumers, hiding the breach in an attempt to mitigate the damage.</p>
                                <p>But also in the year 2017, Facebook had a scandal, the Cambridge Analytica scandal. People were furious over this breach of privacy. How could this hacker group 'Cambridge Analytica' do this? They didn't, because Cambridge Analytica isn't a hacker group, it's a business that buys your data from companies like Facebook and does all sorts of data crunching on them. The problem was how they did this without comsumer's consent and that was a big problem. The company breached data and still made a pretty penny, which most people were furious over. This shows that data privacy isn't just business vs hacker but business vs people and it's time for the people to have the power to win.</p>
                                <p>It is time for the businesses to be held accountable, to have to hold this data in greater security with more government regulations over security and a greater emphasis on cybersecurity. The businesses need to be fined for data breaches and for breaching the privacy of their consumers. They need to have a more transparent terms of conditions, one that can protect them from liabilities but cannot allow them to abuse their power. There needs to be a control of the power they hold in using that data for ads that can influence government elections like in the 2016 election.</p>

                                <h3>Body</h3>
                                <p>Hi (Local MP’s name) this is (your name) and I have concerns over data breaches and data privacy and feel it is an issue that you should discuss in creating legislation. As we move toward the age of technology, we are relying on services and companies to store our personal information on the cloud. But what if our information gets breached? We the people, become prey to the big corporations and receive no compensation or representation whatsoever. Our privacy is incredibly valuable and in cases of data breaches, we want to make sure that we aren’t being trampled over and the business receives no infractions whatsoever. We need to have these regulations against big businesses because of the fact that we need to make sure that citizens can use the internet without having to wonder whether or not they should consider if their data will be safe. One of the issues we want to be considered is that data breaches that do happen must accommodate those who were affected and it must be reported immediately. In the Equifax breach, 143 million consumers were exposed with some of their most valuable information being taken, yet the breach was reported 6 weeks later. If the breach was reported immediately, more people could have taken action in securing their accounts and making sure they weren’t completely vulnerable. However, it would also be wanted that everyone should receive some form of accommodation due to the fact that these companies had taken very important information. Making these companies accountable to these breaches will make them more likely to respect it and treat privacy properly. We understand that some breaches are inevitable, but we also want the companies to be trying to avoid that situation as much as possible as well as making sure that the consumer doesn’t end up completely vulnerable. On a related note to data breaches, data privacy has been abused time and time again. In 2018, it was revealed that Cambridge Analytica had been abusing a survey in conjunction with Facebook to harvest the personal information of many users, and using them in unethical, political ways. A quiz was used to abuse a loophole in Facebook’s API that allowed personal information to be taken, and Facebook friends of the original user as well. This information was used to heavily influence the 2016 presidential campaign, showing how much power that these big companies have and how they can influence elections. The government has certain regulations against itself to ensure the sanctity of the law, yet none are placed on these huge companies that pose just as big a threat to democracy. We need to have stricter policies and consequences to prevent further situations like this. Regulation and fines to businesses that don’t do routine checks, consistently improve their security, and transparency with their policies and terms. We need to have policies so that they immediately report their data, accommodate those who have been affected, and ensure the sanctity of our data privacy.
