								<span class="image main"><img src="images/techuse.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>You use tech and in order to use that tech, you have to give data. You sign up for a bank account and give your sensitive data, but then you can't remember a different password a billion times so you use it once. Well what happens when a hacker gets your data. The hacker can suddenly do an incredible amount of damage. They can look at stuff like:</p>
                                <ul class = "alt">
                                    <li>Payment Information</li>
                                    <li>Passwords</li>
                                    <li>Social Security Numbers</li>
                                    <li>Medical Information</li>
                                    <li>Federal Documents</li>
                                    <li>Signatures</li>
                                    <li>Content dependent on the service</li>
                                </ul>
								<p>This is horrendous, but you can obviously try to change your passwords and protect yourself when these events occur, but most businesses don't even tell you immediately. Some wait months and even in those months don't accomodate or fix the bug. Obviously, having your data given to someone you didn't authorize to is horrible but businesses can use the information that you give them already and hand them to another person you didn't authorize at all, but 'legally.' Essentially, instead of someone else hacking into the business and stealing it, the business just gives it to someone else entirely and makes a quick buck as well. They do this under the fact that you signed the terms of conditions, and they can do anything now. Everyone has a right to privacy and have it protected but these businesses aren't held accountable for these cybersecurity failures with most not even offering accomodation to those who fell prey to the breach. It is time that these businesses are held accountable and can finally start to work so something of the manner can't occur again.</p>

								<h2 class="major">What to do</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/cybersecurity.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>To avoid being subject to these breaches of data and privacy there are a few things that you as an individual can do:</p>
                                <ul class="alt">
                                    <li>Put a minimal amount of your private informatoin online.</li>
                                    <li>Put your information on respected websites.</li>
                                    <li>Email your local MPs, so that businesses have to help protect your data.</li>
                                    <li>Vote for local MPs who will focus on these regulations.</li>
                                    <li>Sign petitions.</li>
                                    <li>Create different unique passwords for all websites and use security measures like 2-Factor Authentication.</li>
                                    <li>If you are affected, find which type of data is released and contact your financial providers.</li>
                                    <li>Check if you have been affected <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/">here.</a></li>
                                    <li>Don't use services like Facebook to sign up for new accounts.</li>
                                    <li>Be aware of internet scams.</li>
                                    <li>Spread the message and become more involved in protecting your data privacy.</li>
                                </ul>
								<p>These are some of the procedures you can take to protect your own data but becoming literate in media and following the #yourdata movement. Making sure you understand which company you can trust and which data you should give or not.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Businesses</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/business.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p> As we move toward the age of technology, we are relying on services and companies to store our personal information on the cloud. But what if that information gets breached? What if everyoneâ€™s personal information was accessible to anyone, including people with malicious intent?</p>
                                <p> In September of 2017, Equifax announced that the information of over 143 million consumers were exposed  in a data breach. The issue here? The breach happened several weeks ago, and no announcement was made until after the initial chaos. The problem here is that Equifax was not completely transparent to their consumers, hiding the breach in an attempt to mitigate the damage.</p>
                                <p>But also in the year 2017, Facebook had a scandal, the Cambridge Analytica scandal. People were furious over this breach of privacy. How could this hacker group 'Cambridge Analytica' do this? They didn't, because Cambridge Analytica isn't a hacker group, it's a business that buys your data from companies like Facebook and does all sorts of data crunching on them. The problem was how they did this without comsumer's consent and that was a big problem. The company breached data and still made a pretty penny, which most people were furious over. This shows that data privacy isn't just business vs hacker but business vs people and it's time for the people to have the power to win.</p>
                                <p>It is time for the businesses to be held accountable, to have to hold this data in greater security with more government regulations over security and a greater emphasis on cybersecurity. The businesses need to be fined for data breaches and for breaching the privacy of their consumers. They need to have a more transparent terms of conditions, one that can protect them from liabilities but cannot allow them to abuse their power. There needs to be a control of the power they hold in using that data for ads that can influence government elections like in the 2016 election.</p>
